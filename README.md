Prediction of Upvotes using Machine Learning

This project is about how we can predict the upvotes on an upcoming reddit post on the basis of the past interaction of the user on the forums. In order to predict this, I would be using a dataset containing past user engagements on the reddit forum. In this particular dataset the userâ€™s past engagement is recorded in terms or reputation, answers, views, user id, username and upvotes. This particular dataset would be used to train our model in order to predict the upvotes. Then our trained model will be used to predict the upvotes on an upcoming reddit post. In order to predict the upvotes, I will be using the regression machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithm used would be Stochastic Gradient Descent and Random Forest Regression.
